# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep pyStructConf and its users safe.

## Supported Versions

This is a young project. We consider the tip of `main` and the most recent tagged releases as supported. The CI covers Python `>= 3.10, < 3.14` (3.10–3.13).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not file a public issue** for security reports.

Instead, use one of the following private channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory** (preferred):
   - Go to the repository **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**.
   - This starts a private discussion where maintainers can coordinate a fix and a disclosure timeline with you.

2. **Email (optional)**:
   - If you prefer email, send a report to the maintainer (replace with your preferred address):
     `TODO: your-security-contact@example.com`
   - Please include a detailed description, affected components, steps to reproduce, and any proposed mitigations if available.

## Handling & Disclosure Process

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as possible.
- We will investigate, reproduce, and determine severity and scope.
- We will work with you on a fix and coordinate a disclosure timeline.
- Once a fix is available, we will publish a new release (if applicable) and a short security advisory/change log entry.

## PGP / Encryption

We currently do not publish a public PGP key. If you require encrypted communications, please open a private advisory first and request an alternative method.

## Out of Scope

- Denial‑of‑service caused by unrealistic limits or input sizes in example configurations.
- Vulnerabilities requiring unsupported Python versions, or non‑default/unsafe interpreter flags.
- Third‑party components used in development only (e.g., test tooling).

Thanks again for your responsible disclosure!
